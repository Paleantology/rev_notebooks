    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "While molecular data have become the default for building phylogenetic\n",
    "trees for many types of evolutionary analysis, morphological data\n",
    "remains important, particularly for analyses involving fossils. The use\n",
    "of morphological data raises special considerations for model-based\n",
    "methods for phylogenetic inference. Morphological data are typically\n",
    "collected to maximize the number of parsimony-informative characters -\n",
    "that is, the characters that provide information in favor of one\n",
    "topology over another. Morphological characters also do not carry common\n",
    "meanings from one character in a matrix to the next; character codings\n",
    "are made arbitrarily. These two factors require extensions to our\n",
    "existing phylogenetic models. Accounting for the complexity of\n",
    "morphological characters remains challenging. This tutorial will provide\n",
    "a discussion of modeling morphological characters, and will demonstrate\n",
    "how to perform Bayesian phylogenetic analysis with morphology using\n",

    "_Rev code specifying the Mk model is on the right-hand panel._\n",
    "\n",
    "Molecular data forms the basis of most phylogenetic analyses today.\n",
    "However, morphological characters remain relevant: Fossils often provide\n",
    "our only direct observation of extinct biodiversity; DNA degradation can\n",
    "make it difficult or impossible to obtain sufficient molecular data from\n",
    "fragile museum specimens. Using morphological data can help researchers\n",
    "include specimens in their phylogeny that might be left out of a\n",
    "molecular tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how morphological characters are modeled, it is important\n",
    "to understand how characters are collected. Unlike in molecular data,\n",
    "for which homology is algorithmically determined, homology in a\n",
    "character is typically assessed by an expert. Biologists will typically\n",
    "decide what characters are homologous by looking across specimens at the\n",
    "same structure in multiple taxa; they may also look at the developmental\n",
    "origin of structures in making this assessment \\cite{Phillips06}. Once\n",
    "homology is determined, characters are broken down into states, or\n",
    "different forms a single character can take. The state `0` commonly\n",
    "refers to absence, meaning that character is not present. In some\n",
    "codings, absence will mean that character has not evolved in that group.\n",
    "In others, absence means that that character has not evolved in that\n",
    "group, and/or that that character has been lost in that group\n",
    "\\cite{freudenstein05}. This type of coding is arbitrary, but both\n",
    "*non-random* and *meaningful*, and poses challenges for how we model\n",
    "the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, most phylogenetic analyses using morphological characters\n",
    "have been performed using the maximum parsimony optimality criterion.\n",
    "Maximum parsimony analysis involves proposing trees from the\n",
    "morphological data. Each tree is evaluated according to how many changes\n",
    "it implied in the data, and the tree that requires the fewest changes is\n",
    "preferred. In this way of estimating a tree, a character that does not\n",
    "change, or changes only in one taxon, cannot be used to discriminate\n",
    "between trees (i.e., it does not favor a topology). Therefore, workers\n",
    "with parsimony typically do not collect characters that are parsimony\n",
    "uninformative.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2001, Paul Lewis \\cite{Lewis2001} introduced a generalization of the\n",
    "Jukes-Cantor model of sequence evolution for use with morphological\n",
    "data. This model, called the Mk (Markov model, assuming each character\n",
    "is in one of *k* states) model provided a mathematical formulation that\n",
    "could be used to estimate trees from morphological data in both\n",
    "likelihood and Bayesian frameworks. While this model is a useful step\n",
    "forward, as a generalization of the Jukes-Cantor, it still makes fairly\n",
    "simplistic assumptions. This tutorial will guide you through estimating\n",
    "a phylogeny with the Mk model, and two useful extensions to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Mk Model \n",
    "\n",
    "The Mk model is a generalization of the Jukes-Cantor model of nucleotide\n",
    "sequence evolution, which we discussed in the [CTMC](https://revbayes.github.io/tutorials/ctmc/) tutorial. \n",
    "The Q matrix for a two-state Mk model looks like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\mu_0 & \\mu_{01} \\\\\n",
    "\\mu_{10} & -\\mu_1  &\\\\\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix} \\mbox{  ,}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This matrix can be expanded to accommodate multi-state data, as well:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\mu_0 & \\mu_{01} & \\mu_{02} & \\mu_{03} \\\\\n",
    "\\mu_{10} & -\\mu_1  & \\mu_{12} & \\mu_{13} \\\\\n",
    "\\mu_{20} & \\mu_{21} & -\\mu_2  & \\mu_{23} \\\\\n",
    "\\mu_{30} & \\mu_{31} & \\mu_{32} & -\\mu_3 \n",
    "\\end{pmatrix} \\mbox{  ,}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the Mk model sets transitions to be equal from any state to any\n",
    "other state. In that sense, our multistate matrix really looks like\n",
    "this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q = \\begin{pmatrix} -(k-1)\\mu & \\mu & \\mu & \\mu \\\\\n",
    "\\mu & -(k-1)\\mu  & \\mu & \\mu \\\\\n",
    "\\mu & \\mu & -(k-1)\\mu  & \\mu \\\\\n",
    "\\mu & \\mu & \\mu & -(k-1)\\mu \\\\\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix} \\mbox{  ,}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is a Jukes-Cantor-like model \\cite{Jukes1969}, state\n",
    "frequencies do not vary as a model parameter. These assumptions may seem\n",
    "unrealistic. However, all models are a compromise between reality and\n",
    "generalizability. Prior work has demonstrated that, in many conditions,\n",
    "the model does perform adequately \\cite{Wright2014}. Because morphological\n",
    "characters do not carry common meaning across sites in a matrix in the\n",
    "way that nucleotide characters do, making assumptions that fit all\n",
    "characters is challenging. A visualization of this simple model can be\n",
    "seen in above graphical model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first perform a phylogenetic analysis using the Mk model. In\n",
    "further sections, we will explore how to relax key assumptions of the Mk\n",
    "model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ascertainment Bias \n",
    "\n",
    "When Lewis first introduced the Mk model, he observed that branch\n",
    "lengths on the trees were greatly inflated. The reason for this is that\n",
    "when morphological characters are collected, characters that do not\n",
    "vary, or vary in a non-parsimony-informative way (such as\n",
    "autapomorphies) are excluded. Excluding these low-rate characters causes\n",
    "the overall amount of evolution to be over-estimated. This causes an\n",
    "inflation in the branch lengths \\cite{Lewis2001}.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, when performing a morphological phylogenetic analysis, it is\n",
    "important to correct for this bias. There are numerous statistically\n",
    "valid ways to perform this correction \\cite{allman08b}. Original corrections\n",
    "simulated invariant and non-parsimony informative characters along the\n",
    "proposed tree. The likelihood of these characters would then be\n",
    "calculated and used to normalize the total likelihood value. RevBayes\n",
    "implements a dynamic programming approach that calculates the same\n",
    "likelihood, but does so faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Inferring a Phylogeny of Fossil Bears Using the Mk Model \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will use morphological character data from 18 taxa\n",
    "of extinct bears \\cite{abella2011}. The dataset contains 62 binary\n",
    "characters, a fairly typical dataset size for morphological characters.\n",
