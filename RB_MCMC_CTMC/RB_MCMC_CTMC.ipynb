    "The Dirichlet distribution assigns probability densities to a group of parameters: *e.g.*,  those that measure proportions and must sum to 1.

The input parameters of a Dirichlet distribution are called shape (or concentration) parameters. The expectation and variance for each variable are related to the sum of the shape parameters. The prior we specified above is a ‘flat’ or symmetric Dirichlet distribution; all of the shape parameters are equal (1,1,1,1,1,1). This describes a model that allows for equal rates of change between nucleotides, such that the expected rate for each is equal to $\\frac{1}{6}$ ({% ref dirichletFig %}a). \n",

    "We might also parameterize the Dirichlet distribution such that all of the shape parameters were equal to 100, which would also specify a prior with an expectation of equal exchangeability rates ({% ref dirichletFig %}b). However, by increasing the values of the shape parameters, `er_prior <- v(100,100,100,100,100,100)`, the Dirichlet distribution will more strongly favor equal exchangeability rates; (*i.e.*, a relatively informative prior). \n",

Under this model, the expected rate for transversions would be $\\frac{4}{32}$ and that for transitions would be $\\frac{8}{32}$, and there would be greater prior probability on sets of GTR rates that matched this configuration ({% ref dirichletFig %}c). \n",

Without strong prior knowledge about the pattern of relative rates, however, we can better reflect our uncertainty by using a vague prior on the GTR rates.

    "\n",
    "Members of the GTR family of substitution models assume that rates are homogeneous across sites, an assumption that is often violated by real data. We can accommodate variation in substitution rate among sites (ASRV) by adopting the discrete-gamma model {% cite Yang1994a %}. This model assumes that the substitution rate at each site is a random variable that is described by a discretized gamma distribution, which has two parameters: the shape parameter, $\\alpha$, and the rate parameter, $\\beta$. In order that we can interpret the branch lengths as the expected number of substitutions per site, this model assumes that the mean site rate is equal to 1. The mean of the gamma is equal to $\\alpha/\\beta$, so a mean-one gamma is specified by setting the two parameters to be equal, $\\alpha=\\beta$. This means that we can fully describe the gamma distribution with the single shape parameter, $\\alpha$. The degree of among-site substitution rate variation is inversely proportional to the value of the $\\alpha$-shape parameter. As the value of the $\\alpha$-shape increases, the gamma distribution increasingly resembles a normal distribution with decreasing variance, which therefore corresponds to decreasing levels of ASRV ({% ref asrhGammaFig %}). By contrast, when the value of the $\\alpha$-shape parameter is $< 1$, the gamma distribution assumes a concave distribution that concentrates most of the prior density on low rates, but retains some prior mass on sites with very high rates, which therefore corresponds to high levels of ASRV ({% ref asrhGammaFig %}). Note that, when $\\alpha = 1$, the gamma distribution collapses to an exponential distribution with a rate parameter equal to $\\beta$.\n",

    "We typically lack prior knowledge regarding the degree of ASRV for a given alignment. \n",
    "Accordingly, rather than specifying a precise value of $\\alpha$, we can instead estimate the value of the $\\alpha$-shape parameter from the data. This requires that we specify a diffuse (relatively ['uninformative'](http://andrewgelman.com/2013/11/21/hidden-dangers-noninformative-priors/)) prior on the $\\alpha$-shape parameter. For this analysis, we will use a lognormal distribution with a mean parameter, `alpha_prior_mean`, equal to `5.0`, and standard deviation, `alpha_prior_sd`, equal to 0.587405 (thus, 95% of the prior density spans exactly one order of magnitude).\n",

    "This approach for accommodating ASRV is another example of a hierarchical model ({% ref fig_gtrg %}). \n",
    "That is, variation in substitution rates across sites is addressed by applying a site-specific rate multiplier to each of the $j$ sites, $r_j$. \n",
    "These rate-multipliers are drawn from a discrete, mean-one gamma distribution; the shape of this prior distribution (and the corresponding degree of ASRV) is governed by the $\\alpha$-shape parameter. The $\\alpha$-shape parameter, in turn, is treated as a lognormal distributed random variable. Finally, the shape of the lognormal prior is governed by the mean and standard deviation parameters, which are set to fixed values.\n",

    "The way the ASRV model is implemented involves discretizing the mean-one gamma distribution into a set number of rate categories, $k$. Thus, we can analytically marginalize over the uncertainty in the rate at each site. The likelihood of each site is averaged over the $k$ rate categories, where the rate multiplier is the mean (or median) of each of the discrete $k$ categories. To specify this, we need a deterministic node that is a vector that will hold the set of $k$ rates drawn from the gamma distribution with $k$ rate categories. The `fnDiscretizeGamma()` function returns this deterministic node and takes three arguments: the shape and rate of the gamma distribution and the number of categories. Since we want to discretize a mean-one gamma distribution, we can pass in `alpha` for both the shape and rate.\n",

That is, we assume that the sequence data are random variables; specifically, we assume that they are realizations of the specified `PhyloCTMC` distribution. However, some sites may not be free to vary—when the substitution rate of a site is zero, it is said to be *invariable*. Invariable sites are often confused with *invariant* sites—when each species exhibits the same state, it is said to be invariant. The concepts are related but distinct. If a site is truly invariable, it will necessarily give rise to an invariant site pattern, as such sites will always have a zero substitution rate. However, an invariant site pattern may be achieved via multiple substitutions that happen to end in the same state for every species.\n",
