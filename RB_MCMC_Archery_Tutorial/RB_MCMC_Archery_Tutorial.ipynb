    "from the target’s center is measured. Let’s assume that the distance of\n",
    "each arrow from the bullseye follows an exponential\n",
    "distribution—*i.e.,* $d\\sim\\mbox{Exp}(\\mu^{-1})$. This implies the archer has an inherent ability to shoot arrows at an average distance $\\mu$. Then, the probability density of each arrow distance $d_i$ is \n",

In virtually all practical cases, we cannot compute the posterior distribution directly and instead use numerical procedures, such as a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Therefore, we will also have to write a MCMC algorithm that samples parameter values in the frequency of their posterior probability.\n",

Following the graph in Fig 3, we see an arrow connecting $\\alpha$ and the variable $\\mu$. That simply means that $\\mu$ depends on $\\alpha$. More specifically, $\\mu$ is a stochastic variable (shown as a solid circle) that is drawn from an exponential distribution with parameter $\\alpha$. Another constant variable, $n$, represents the number of shots taken by the archer. Finally, we have the observed data $\\bar d$ which is drawn from a gamma distribution with parameters $\\mu$ and $n$, as can be seen by the arrows pointing from those parameters to $d$. Furthermore, the solid circle of $\\bar d$ is shaded which means that the variable has data attached to it.\n",

    "this scaling factor by the current value. An interesting feature of this\n",
    "move is that it is not symmetrical and thus needs a Hastings ratio (this\n",
    "is the same as the proposal ratio given in Section\n",

    "\n",
    "So far we have used a fairly simple exponential prior with $\\alpha = 1$.\n",
    "However, we have not explored what impact this prior has on our estimate\n",
    "of $\\mu$, or whether it is an appropriate prior distribution. If the\n",
    "prior is very informative, then our posterior distribution will be\n",
    "relatively similar to our prior beliefs. In order to explore the\n",
    "informativeness of the prior, we can change the true value of $\\mu$ so\n",
    "that it is very different from our prior belief. If we are still able to\n",
    "recover the correct value of $\\mu$, then we can say that our prior is\n",
    "fairly uninformative.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we find that our prior distribution is very informative, we have two\n",
    "options for minimizing sensitivity to the prior. First, we can use a\n",
    "less informative prior distribution. For example, since our data is\n",
    "exponentially distributed, a good choice for an uninformative prior is a\n",
    "$Gamma(0,0)$ distribution (this is the [Jeffreys prior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffreys_prior)). Unfortunately,\n",
    "this prior distribution is *improper* (it does not integrate to 1), and\n",
    "so we can’t use it in RevBayes. However we can approximate this prior\n",
    "distribution by using very small parameter values, e.g. $Gamma(0.001,\n",
    "0.001)$. As you can see in {% ref gamma_distribution %}, compared\n",
    "to the exponential distribution, the $Gamma(0.001, 0.001)$ distribution is\n",

    "The second and simplest way we can overcome the informativeness of the\n",
